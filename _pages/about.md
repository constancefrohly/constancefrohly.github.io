Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Economics at Sciences Po, under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/pierrecahuc/'>Pierre Cahuc</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/emericmlhenry/home'>Emeric Henry</a>. 

My interests are in Education and Experimental Economics. I work on school choice and social segregation, with a particular focus on the role of information.

Don't hesitate to get in touch!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a p picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

 Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

 Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
